                <p className="text-slate-300 mb-4">
                    I am a student at Cebu Institute of Technology, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.
                    My passion lies in creating efficient and user-friendly web applications that solve real-world problems.

                <p className="text-slate-300 mb-4">
                    With a strong foundation in both frontend and backend technologies, I enjoy the challenge of building
                    full-stack applications. I&apos;m constantly learning and exploring new technologies to stay at the forefront
                    of web development.

                <p className="text-slate-300">
                    When I&apos;m not coding, you can find me exploring new coding challenges, contributing to open-source projects,
                    or enjoying a good book on software architecture and design patterns.
